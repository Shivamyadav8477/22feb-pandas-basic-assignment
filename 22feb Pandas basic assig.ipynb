    "Pandas provides a wide range of functions and methods for manipulating data in a DataFrame. Here are some common functions and operations you can perform on a Pandas DataFrame, along with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Filtering Data**:\n",
    "   - `df[df['column'] > value]`: You can filter rows based on a condition in a specific column.\n",
    "   - Example: Filter rows where the \"Age\" column is greater than 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Selecting Columns**:\n",
    "   - `df['column_name']` or `df[['col1', 'col2']]`: You can select one or multiple columns.\n",
    "   - Example: Select the \"Name\" column.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sorting Data**:\n",
    "   - `df.sort_values(by='column_name')`: Sort the DataFrame by a specific column.\n",
    "   - Example: Sort the DataFrame by the \"Age\" column in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Grouping and Aggregation**:\n",
    "   - `df.groupby('group_column')['aggregation_column'].agg('aggregation_function')`: Group data by a column and perform aggregations.\n",
    "   - Example: Group by \"Category\" and calculate the mean of \"Price\" for each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Merging and Joining DataFrames**:\n",
    "   - `pd.concat([df1, df2])` or `df1.merge(df2, on='key_column')`: Combine data from multiple DataFrames.\n",
    "   - Example: Merge two DataFrames based on a common \"ID\" column.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Pivoting and Reshaping**:\n",
    "   - `df.pivot(index='row_index', columns='column_index', values='value_column')`: Reshape data from long to wide format.\n",
    "   - Example: Pivot a DataFrame to convert \"Year-Month\" data into a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Handling Missing Data**:\n",
    "   - `df.isna()`, `df.dropna()`, `df.fillna(value)`: Identify, drop, or fill missing values.\n",
    "   - Example: Replace missing values in the \"Age\" column with the mean age.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Adding and Deleting Columns**:\n",
    "   - `df['new_column'] = value` or `del df['column_name']`: Add or delete columns.\n",
    "   - Example: Add a new column \"Total\" that sums two existing columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Applying Functions**:\n",
    "   - `df.apply(function)`: Apply a custom function to each row or column.\n",
    "   - Example: Apply a function to calculate the age category for each person based on their age.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Dropping Duplicates**:\n",
    "    - `df.drop_duplicates(subset='column_name')`: Remove duplicate rows.\n",
    "    - Example: Remove duplicate records based on the \"ID\" column.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **String Operations**:\n",
    "    - `df['column'].str.method()`: Perform string operations on text columns.\n",
    "    - Example: Convert text in the \"Name\" column to uppercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **DateTime Operations**:\n",
    "    - `pd.to_datetime(df['date_column'])`: Convert a string column to a datetime object.\n",
    "    - Example: Convert a \"Date\" column to datetime for time-based analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Applying Conditional Logic**:\n",
    "    - `np.where(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)`: Apply conditional logic to create a new column.\n",
    "    - Example: Create a new column \"Status\" based on a condition in the \"Score\" column.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just some of the many functions and operations available in Pandas for data manipulation. The choice of function depends on the specific data manipulation task you need to perform in your analysis or data preprocessing workflow."
